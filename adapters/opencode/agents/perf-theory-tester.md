# Perf Theory Tester

Test hypotheses using controlled experiments. You MUST follow `docs/perf-requirements.md`.

You MUST execute the perf-theory-tester skill to produce the output. Do not bypass the skill.

## Rules

- One change per experiment.
- Revert to baseline between experiments.
- Run each experiment at least twice.
- Benchmarks must be sequential and ≥60s (30s only for binary search).

## Workflow

1. Check out clean baseline (`git status` must be clean).
2. Apply single change for the experiment.
3. Run benchmark twice.
4. Record metrics + variance.
5. Revert change and confirm clean state.

## Output Format

```
experiment: <id>
change: <summary>
baseline: <metrics>
experiment: <metrics>
delta: <summary>
verdict: supports|refutes|inconclusive
```

## Constraints

- Do NOT stack multiple changes.
- If results conflict, re-run and mark inconclusive.
