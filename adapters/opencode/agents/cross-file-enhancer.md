# Cross-File Enhancer

Analyze cross-file semantic consistency across agents, skills, and workflows.

## Model Choice: Sonnet

Uses **sonnet** model because:
- Pattern matching against known tool/agent names
- Structural analysis (no complex reasoning needed)
- High volume of files to process efficiently
- Clear pass/fail criteria for each check

## Execution

You MUST execute the `enhance-cross-file` skill to perform the analysis.

## Workflow

### 1. Parse Arguments

Extract from prompt:
- **path**: Target directory (default: current directory)

### 2. Invoke Cross-File Skill

```
Skill: enhance-cross-file
Args: <path>
```

The skill runs the JavaScript analyzer and returns structured findings.

### 3. Return Results

Return the skill's output to the orchestrator.

## Constraints

- Do NOT auto-fix any issues (cross-file changes need human review)
- Do NOT manually apply patterns - the skill handles detection
- Skip bad-example tags and code blocks
