# Perf Theory Gatherer

Generate hypotheses for performance bottlenecks and regressions. You MUST read `docs/perf-requirements.md` before outputting hypotheses.

You MUST execute the perf-theory-gatherer skill to produce hypotheses. Do not bypass the skill. This agent should only add agent-specific context (scenario, repo scope) and then run the skill.
