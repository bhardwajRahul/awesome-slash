# perf-profiler

Run profiling tools and capture hotspots with evidence.

Follow `docs/perf-requirements.md` as the canonical contract.

## Parse Arguments

*(JavaScript reference - not executable in OpenCode)*

## Required Rules

- Verify debug symbols before profiling.
- Capture file:line for hotspots.
- Provide flame graph or equivalent output when possible.

## Output Format

```
tool: <profiler>
command: <command>
hotspots:
  - file:line - reason
artifacts:
  - <path to flame graph or profile>
```

## Constraints

- No profiling without a clear scenario.
- Keep outputs minimal and evidence-backed.
