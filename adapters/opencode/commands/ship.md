# /ship - Complete PR Workflow

End-to-end workflow: commit - PR - CI - review - merge - deploy - validate - production.

Auto-adapts to your project's CI platform, deployment platform, and branch strategy.

---

<mandatory-steps>
## Mandatory Steps - No Shortcuts

Phase 4 (CI & Review Monitor Loop) is mandatory even when called from /next-task.

| Step | Requirement | Why It Matters |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| 3-minute initial wait | Must wait after PR creation | Auto-reviewers need time to analyze |
| Monitor loop iterations | Must run the full loop | Catches issues humans miss |
| Address all comments | Zero unresolved threads | Quality gate, blocks merge otherwise |

### Forbidden Actions
- Checking CI once and proceeding to merge
- Skipping the 3-minute initial wait for auto-reviewers
- Ignoring "minor" or "nit" comments
- Merging with unresolved comment threads
- Rationalizing "no comments yet means ready to merge"

### Required Verification Output

Before proceeding to merge, output:
```
[VERIFIED] Phase 4: wait=180s, iterations=N, unresolved=0
```
</mandatory-steps>

## Integration with /next-task

When called from `/next-task` workflow (via `--state-file`):
- **SKIPS Phase 5** internal review agents (already done by Phase 9 review loop)
- **SKIPS deslop/docs** (already done by deslop-agent, sync-docs-agent)
- **Trusts** that all quality gates passed

**CRITICAL: Phase 4 ALWAYS runs** - even from /next-task. External auto-reviewers (Gemini, Copilot, CodeRabbit) comment AFTER PR creation and must be addressed.

When called standalone, runs full workflow including review.

## Arguments

Parse from $ARGUMENTS:
- **--strategy**: Merge strategy: `squash` (default) | `merge` | `rebase`
- **--skip-tests**: Skip test validation (dangerous)
- **--dry-run**: Show what would happen without executing
- **--state-file**: Path to workflow state file (for /next-task integration)

## State Integration

*(JavaScript reference - not executable in OpenCode)*

## Phase 1: Pre-flight Checks

*(Bash command with Node.js require - adapt for OpenCode)*

### Verify Git Status

```bash
# Check for uncommitted changes
if [ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]; then
  NEEDS_COMMIT="true"
else
  NEEDS_COMMIT="false"
fi

# Must be on feature branch
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "$MAIN_BRANCH" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Cannot ship from $MAIN_BRANCH, must be on feature branch"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Dry Run Mode

If `--dry-run` provided, show plan and exit:
```markdown
## Dry Run: What Would Happen
**Branch**: ${CURRENT_BRANCH} → **Target**: ${MAIN_BRANCH}
**Workflow**: ${WORKFLOW} | **CI**: ${CI_PLATFORM} | **Deploy**: ${DEPLOYMENT}
```

## Phase 2: Commit Current Work

Only if `NEEDS_COMMIT=true`:

```bash
# Stage relevant files (exclude secrets)
git status --porcelain | awk '{print $2}' | grep -v '\.env' | xargs git add

# Generate semantic commit message
# Format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>
# Types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore

git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
${COMMIT_MESSAGE}
EOF
)"

COMMIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
echo "[OK] Committed: $COMMIT_SHA"
```

## Phase 3: Create Pull Request

```bash
# Push to remote
git push -u origin $CURRENT_BRANCH

# Create PR
PR_URL=$(gh pr create \
  --base "$MAIN_BRANCH" \
  --title "$PR_TITLE" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- Bullet points of changes

## Test Plan
- How to test

## Related Issues
Closes #X
EOF
)")

PR_NUMBER=$(echo $PR_URL | grep -oP '/pull/\K\d+')
echo "[OK] Created PR #$PR_NUMBER: $PR_URL"
```

<phase-4>
## Phase 4: CI & Review Monitor Loop

**Blocking gate** - This phase is mandatory. Cannot proceed to merge without completing.

See `ship-ci-review-loop.md` for full implementation details.

### Summary

The monitor loop must:
1. Wait for CI to pass
2. Wait 3 minutes for auto-reviewers (mandatory on first iteration)
3. Address all comments (zero unresolved threads)
4. Iterate until clean

**Every comment must be addressed:**
- Critical/High issues: Fix immediately
- Medium/Minor issues: Fix (shows quality)
- Questions: Answer with explanation
- False positives: Reply explaining why, then resolve

Do not ignore comments. Do not leave comments unresolved.
Do not skip the 3-minute wait. Do not check CI once and merge.

### Loop Structure

```bash
MAX_ITERATIONS=10
INITIAL_WAIT=180  # 3 minutes - do not reduce or skip

iteration=0
while [ $iteration -lt $MAX_ITERATIONS ]; do
  iteration=$((iteration + 1))
  echo "[CI Monitor] Iteration $iteration"

  # 1. Wait for CI to complete
  wait_for_ci || { fix_ci_failures; continue; }

  # 2. First iteration must wait for auto-reviews
  if [ $iteration -eq 1 ]; then
    echo "Waiting ${INITIAL_WAIT}s for auto-reviewers..."
    sleep $INITIAL_WAIT
    echo "[DONE] Initial wait complete"
  fi

  # 3. Check feedback
  FEEDBACK=$(check_pr_feedback $PR_NUMBER)
  UNRESOLVED=$(echo "$FEEDBACK" | jq -r '.unresolvedThreads')

  echo "Unresolved threads: $UNRESOLVED"

  # 4. Exit only if zero unresolved
  if [ "$UNRESOLVED" -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "[OK] All comments resolved - ready to merge"
    break
  fi

  # 5. Address all feedback (see ship-ci-review-loop.md)
  address_all_feedback $PR_NUMBER

  # 6. Commit and push fixes
  commit_and_push_fixes "fix: address review feedback (iteration $iteration)"

  # 7. Wait before next iteration
  sleep 30
done

# Verification output - mandatory
echo "[VERIFIED] Phase 4: wait=180s, iterations=$iteration, unresolved=0"
```

### Forbidden Actions in Phase 4
- `sleep 0` or removing the initial wait
- Checking CI once without running the loop
- Breaking out of loop with unresolved comments
- Skipping to Phase 6 (merge) without verification output
</phase-4>

## Phase 5: Review Loop (Standalone Only)

**Skip if called from /next-task** (review already done).

*(JavaScript reference - not executable in OpenCode)*

When running standalone, launch core review passes in parallel (error handling is part of code quality):

*(JavaScript reference - not executable in OpenCode)*

Iterate until no open (non-false-positive) issues remain (max 3 iterations if running standalone).

<phase-6>
## Phase 6: Merge PR

Pre-merge checks (do not skip):

*(Bash command with Node.js require - adapt for OpenCode)*
</phase-6>

## Phases 7-10: Deploy & Validate

**Skip if `WORKFLOW="single-branch"`**

See `ship-deployment.md` for platform-specific details:
- Phase 7: Deploy to Development (Railway, Vercel, Netlify)
- Phase 8: Validate Development (health checks, smoke tests)
- Phase 9: Deploy to Production (merge to prod branch)
- Phase 10: Validate Production (with auto-rollback on failure)

## Phase 11: Cleanup

```bash
# Clean up worktrees
git worktree list --porcelain | grep "worktree" | grep -v "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" | while read -r wt; do
  WORKTREE_PATH=$(echo $wt | awk '{print $2}')
  git worktree remove $WORKTREE_PATH --force 2>/dev/null || true
done
```

### Close GitHub Issue (if applicable)

If the task came from a GitHub issue, close it with a completion comment:

```bash
if [ -n "$TASK_ID" ] && [ "$TASK_SOURCE" = "github" ]; then
  # Post completion comment
  gh issue comment "$TASK_ID" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
[DONE] **Task Completed Successfully**

**PR**: #${PR_NUMBER}
**Status**: Merged to ${MAIN_BRANCH}
**Commit**: ${MERGE_SHA}

### Summary
- Implementation completed as planned
- All review comments addressed
- CI checks passed
- Merged successfully

---
_This issue was automatically processed by awesome-slash /next-task workflow._
_Closing issue as the work has been completed and merged._
EOF
)"

  # Close the issue
  gh issue close "$TASK_ID" --reason completed

  echo "[OK] Closed issue #$TASK_ID with completion comment"
fi
```

### Remove Task from Registry

*(JavaScript reference - not executable in OpenCode)*

### Local Branch Cleanup

```bash
git checkout $MAIN_BRANCH
# Feature branch already deleted by --delete-branch
git branch -D $CURRENT_BRANCH 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Phase 12: Completion Report

```markdown
# Deployment Complete

## Pull Request
**Number**: #${PR_NUMBER} | **Status**: Merged to ${MAIN_BRANCH}

## Review Results
- Code Quality: [OK] | Error Handling: [OK] | Test Coverage: [OK] | CI: [OK]

## Deployments
${WORKFLOW === 'dev-prod' ?
  `Development: ${DEV_URL} [OK] | Production: ${PROD_URL} [OK]` :
  `Production: Deployed to ${MAIN_BRANCH}`}

[OK] Successfully shipped!
```

### Workflow Hook Response

After displaying the completion report, output JSON for the SubagentStop hook:

```json
{"ok": true, "nextPhase": "completed", "status": "shipped"}
```

This allows the `/next-task` workflow to detect that `/ship` completed successfully.

## Error Handling

See `ship-error-handling.md` for detailed error handling:
- GitHub CLI not available
- CI failures
- Merge conflicts
- Deployment failures
- Production validation failures with rollback

## Important Notes

- Requires GitHub CLI (gh) for PR workflow
- Auto-adapts to single-branch or multi-branch workflow
- Platform-specific CI and deployment monitoring
- Automatic rollback on production failures
- Respects project conventions (commit style, PR format)
